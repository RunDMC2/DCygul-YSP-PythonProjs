# Dylan Cygul and Serkan Aymaz
1 & 2. Github Usernames and Partner Name:
-	Serkan Aymaz: serkturk
-	Dylan Cygul: RunDMC2
3. Research Question:
-	How does the global population affect the prices of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables?
4. Expected Coding Work to be Done:
-	Graph data and use a trendline
-	Calculate statistics of the data sets (e.g. max, min, stat dev, etc.) and run comparisons
5. Possible Packages to be Used:
-	Matplotlib
-	Pandas
-	Numpy
6. Possible Datasets to be Used:
-	Global population from 1960 to present (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?end=2021&start=1960&view=chart)
-	Fresh fruit and vegetable prices from the 1960s to present (https://www.thepeoplehistory.com/90sfood.html). Since this data isn’t formatted in a dataset, we will use the information to make our own and incorporate it into our program.
-	Fresh fruit and vegetable prices from 2020 (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/fruit-and-vegetable-prices.aspx)
-	Frozen fruit and vegetable prices (data set TBD)
7. Expected Results:
-	As the global population increases, the prices of fresh and frozen fruits will increase, and frozen produce will increase more than fresh.

9. Considerations:
- Data Limitations: Not all data for the fruits and vegetables span for the same time. For example, the orange data is from 1980 to 2023, while the carrot data is from 1980 to 2014.
Since our data is an average, it may not be perfectly representative of different places.
- Visualization Choices: Most of the graphs are line graphs, which may not be the best choice when there’s many values. A scatter plot may have shown the data trends better since it shows exact points.
